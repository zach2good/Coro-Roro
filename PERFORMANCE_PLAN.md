# Coro-Roro Performance Optimization Plan

## Executive Summary

The Coro-Roro scheduler currently has **extremely high thread switching overhead** (23,338μs per switch) that makes it unsuitable for high-performance game server workloads requiring 2.5+ ticks per second across 20+ zones. This document outlines a comprehensive optimization strategy to achieve the target performance of **400ms per tick per zone**.

**Important Design Decision:** To achieve the required performance targets, we are willing to break the original encapsulation rule that kept Task and coroutine implementation completely separate from the scheduler. The handle-based optimizations require tight coupling between coroutines and scheduler for optimal performance.

**Scheduler Reference Strategy:** We will avoid global, static, or thread_local scheduler references. Instead, the scheduler reference will be automatically propagated through the coroutine promise system. The parent coroutine's scheduler reference is automatically inherited by child coroutines, making it invisible to client code while maintaining clean dependency injection.

**Task Execution Dependency:** Tasks (coroutines) will require a scheduler to function - they cannot be executed standalone. This is an acceptable tradeoff for the performance benefits of handle-based optimizations and automatic scheduler reference propagation.

## Current Performance Analysis

### Performance Baseline
- **Thread switching overhead:** 23,338μs per switch
- **Symmetric transfer overhead:** 125μs per operation (excellent)
- **LandSandBoat impact:** 118,764ms per tick (target: <200ms)
- **Test results:** 46 passing tests, 4 failing performance tests

### Performance Spectrum
| Pattern | Overhead | LandSandBoat Impact | Status |
|---------|----------|-------------------|---------|
| Pure Symmetric Transfer (Task->Task) | 125μs | 247ms | ✅ Excellent |
| Single Thread Switch (Task->AsyncTask) | 22,153μs | 43,862ms | ❌ Critical |
| Pure Thread Switching (AsyncTask->AsyncTask) | 28,929μs | 57,279ms | ❌ Critical |
| Mixed Workload (Realistic) | 59,982μs | 118,764ms | ❌ Critical |

### Key Findings
1. **Symmetric transfer is excellent** - no optimization needed
2. **Thread switching is the bottleneck** - 99.6% reduction needed
3. **Lock-free queues are already implemented** - queue operations are fast
4. **Coroutine suspension/resumption overhead** is the main issue
5. **Memory allocation and context management** are significant overhead sources

## Performance Requirements

### Target Specifications
- **Per zone:** 400ms per tick (2.5 ticks per second)
- **Single zone focus:** One zone must maintain 2.5 ticks/second regardless of player count
- **Multi-zone scaling:** Support 100 zones on single main thread (current: 20 zones)
- **Total main thread budget:** 4ms per zone per tick (400ms ÷ 100 zones)
- **Scalability:** Linear scaling from 1 to 100 zones without performance degradation

### Current Reality vs Target
- **Current best case:** 247ms per zone (this was probably an accident)
- **Current realistic case:** 118,764ms per zone (29,591% over target)
- **Gap to target:** 99.7% improvement needed for realistic workloads
- **Symmetric transfer:** Already exceeds target performance
- **Thread switching:** Primary bottleneck preventing scaling to 100 zones

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Bottlenecks
1. **Coroutine suspension/resumption overhead** (~15,000μs)
2. **OS-level thread context switching** (~5,000μs)
3. **ExecutionContext setup/teardown** (~2,000μs)
4. **Lambda capture and memory allocation** (~1,000μs)
5. **Worker thread wakeup/sleep cycles** (~500μs)

### Architectural Issues
1. **Individual AsyncTask operations** create too many thread switches
2. **Complex context transfer** between main thread and workers
3. **Memory allocation per coroutine** instead of pooling
4. **No batching** of similar operations
5. **Inefficient worker thread management**

## Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Handle-Based Thread Switching

#### Concept
Replace complex coroutine context transfer with **simple handle transfer**. This requires tight coupling between coroutines and scheduler:

```cpp
// Current: Complex context transfer
auto result = co_await [&]() -> AsyncTask<int> {
    // Entire coroutine frame gets transferred
    co_return 42;
}();

// Proposed: Handle transfer (requires scheduler integration)
auto result = co_await [&]() -> AsyncTask<int> {
    // Coroutine frame stays on main thread
    // Only handle gets transferred to worker
    // Scheduler directly manages coroutine state
    co_return 42;
}();
```

#### Implementation
```cpp
class HandleBasedScheduler {
    moodycamel::ConcurrentQueue<std::coroutine_handle<>> handleQueue;
    
    template<typename T>
    AsyncTask<T> scheduleAsync(std::function<T()> work) {
        // Create coroutine on main thread
        auto coroutine = [work]() -> Task<T> {
            auto result = work();
            co_return result;
        }();
        
        // Transfer just the handle
        auto handle = coroutine.getHandle();
        handleQueue.enqueue(handle);
        
        return AsyncTask<T>(coroutine);
    }
};
```

**Note:** This implementation requires the scheduler to have direct access to coroutine internals, breaking the original encapsulation boundary. The coroutine promise type must be modified to expose handles to the scheduler.

#### Expected Benefits
- **Memory transfer reduction:** 90%+
- **Context setup elimination:** 80%+
- **Thread switching overhead:** 23,338μs → 1,000-5,000μs
- **LandSandBoat impact:** 118,764ms → 5,000-25,000ms
- **Zone scaling:** Enable 100 zones (5x improvement over current 20 zones)

### Phase 2: Advanced Handle Transfer Optimizations

#### Optimization 2.1: Direct Handle Transfer
```cpp
class DirectHandleScheduler {
    std::vector<std::coroutine_handle<>> workerHandles;
    std::atomic<int> currentWorker{0};
    
    void enqueueHandle(std::coroutine_handle<> handle) {
        // Direct assignment - no queue overhead
        int worker = currentWorker.fetch_add(1) % workers.size();
        workerHandles[worker] = handle;
        workerSignals[worker].notify_one();
    }
};
```
**Expected improvement:** 1,000μs → 100-500μs per switch

#### Optimization 2.2: Handle Pooling
```cpp
class HandlePool {
    std::vector<std::coroutine_handle<>> handlePool;
    std::atomic<int> nextHandle{0};
    
    std::coroutine_handle<> acquire() {
        int index = nextHandle.fetch_add(1) % handlePool.size();
        return handlePool[index];
    }
};
```
**Expected improvement:** 100μs → 50-200μs per switch

#### Optimization 2.3: Lock-Free Direct Transfer
```cpp
class LockFreeHandleScheduler {
    struct WorkerSlot {
        std::atomic<std::coroutine_handle<>> handle{nullptr};
        std::atomic<bool> ready{false};
    };
    
    void enqueueHandle(std::coroutine_handle<> handle) {
        for (auto& slot : workerSlots) {
            std::coroutine_handle<> expected = nullptr;
            if (slot.handle.compare_exchange_strong(expected, handle)) {
                slot.ready.store(true);
                return;
            }
        }
    }
};
```
**Expected improvement:** 50μs → 10-100μs per switch

#### Optimization 2.4: Batch Handle Transfer
```cpp
class BatchHandleScheduler {
    struct HandleBatch {
        std::vector<std::coroutine_handle<>> handles;
        std::atomic<bool> ready{false};
    };
    
    void enqueueHandle(std::coroutine_handle<> handle) {
        auto& batch = workerBatches[currentWorker];
        batch.handles.push_back(handle);
        
        if (batch.handles.size() >= BATCH_SIZE) {
            batch.ready.store(true);
        }
    }
};
```
**Expected improvement:** 10μs → 5-50μs per operation (when batched)

#### Optimization 2.5: Zero-Copy Handle Transfer
```cpp
class ZeroCopyHandleScheduler {
    struct SharedHandle {
        std::coroutine_handle<> handle;
        std::atomic<bool> ready{false};
    };
    
    void enqueueHandle(std::coroutine_handle<> handle) {
        // Direct assignment in shared memory
        sharedHandles[currentWorker].handle = handle;
        sharedHandles[currentWorker].ready.store(true);
    }
};
```
**Expected improvement:** 5μs → 1-10μs per switch

### Phase 3: AsyncTask Batching

#### Concept
Instead of 1,980 individual AsyncTasks, use batched operations:

```cpp
// Current: Individual operations
for (auto& entity : entities) {
    auto path = co_await [&]() -> AsyncTask<std::vector<int>> {
        return calculatePath(entity);
    }();
}

// Proposed: Batched operations
auto paths = co_await [&]() -> AsyncTask<std::vector<std::vector<int>>> {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> results;
    for (auto& entity : entities) {
        results.push_back(calculatePath(entity));
    }
    return results;
}();
```

#### Implementation Strategy
1. **Create BatchAsyncTask<T> template**
2. **Implement vector-based batching** for maximum efficiency
3. **Add batching utilities** for common patterns
4. **Update LandSandBoat code** to use batched operations

#### Expected Benefits
- **Thread switch reduction:** 90%+ (1,980 → 20-50 switches)
- **Overall performance improvement:** 25-50%
- **LandSandBoat impact:** 5,000ms → 2,500-3,750ms
- **Zone scaling:** Enable 100 zones with efficient batching

### Phase 4: Memory Optimization

#### Memory Pooling
```cpp
class MemoryPool {
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<ExecutionContext>> contextPool;
    std::atomic<int> nextContext{0};
    
    ExecutionContext* acquire() {
        int index = nextContext.fetch_add(1) % contextPool.size();
        return contextPool[index].get();
    }
};
```

#### Allocation Reduction
- **Pool coroutine frames** instead of allocating per operation
- **Reuse ExecutionContext objects** across operations
- **Use stack allocation** for small objects
- **Implement object pooling** for frequently allocated types

#### Expected Benefits
- **Memory allocation overhead:** 80%+ reduction
- **Cache performance:** Improved due to better memory locality
- **Overall performance:** 20-30% improvement under memory pressure
- **Zone scaling:** Reduce memory pressure for 100 zones

### Phase 5: Worker Thread Optimization

#### Work Stealing
```cpp
class WorkStealingScheduler {
    std::vector<moodycamel::ConcurrentQueue<Task>> workerQueues;
    
    void scheduleWork(Task task) {
        // Push to any available queue
        workerQueues[random() % workerQueues.size()].enqueue(task);
    }
    
    bool stealFromOtherQueues(Task& task) {
        for (auto& queue : workerQueues) {
            if (queue.try_dequeue(task)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

#### Adaptive Spinning
```cpp
class AdaptiveSpinningScheduler {
    std::chrono::microseconds spinDuration;
    
    void workerLoop() {
        while (running) {
            if (hasWork()) {
                processWork();
                spinDuration = std::min(spinDuration * 2, 1000us);
            } else {
                std::this_thread::yield();
                spinDuration = std::max(spinDuration / 2, 1us);
            }
        }
    }
};
```

#### Expected Benefits
- **Worker utilization:** 90%+ improvement
- **Context switching:** 50%+ reduction
- **Overall performance:** 10-15% improvement
- **Zone scaling:** Efficient worker management for 100 zones

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

2. **Thread safety** - Coroutine state might not be thread-safe
3. **Memory ownership** - Complex ownership semantics
4. **Performance regression** - Optimizations might not work as expected
5. **Scheduler reference propagation** - Complex promise system integration for automatic propagation
6. **Task execution dependency** - Tasks cannot function without scheduler, breaking standalone usage patterns

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Comprehensive testing** - Extensive test coverage for all optimizations
2. **Gradual rollout** - Implement optimizations incrementally
3. **Performance monitoring** - Continuous performance measurement
4. **Fallback mechanisms** - Ability to revert to previous implementation

### Success Criteria
1. **Thread switching overhead:** <1,000μs per switch
2. **LandSandBoat impact:** <400ms per tick (target: 2.5 ticks/second)
3. **Per zone performance:** <400ms per tick
4. **Zone scaling:** Support 100 zones (5x improvement over current 20)
5. **Test suite:** All tests passing
6. **Syntax compatibility:** No changes to existing code
7. **Architecture:** Tight coupling between coroutines and scheduler is acceptable for performance
8. **Dependency injection:** Scheduler reference automatically propagated through coroutine promise system, invisible to client code
9. **Task execution:** Tasks require scheduler to function (acceptable tradeoff for performance)

## Conclusion

The current Coro-Roro scheduler has significant performance issues due to high thread switching overhead. However, the proposed optimization strategy provides a clear path to achieving the target performance of 400ms per tick per zone (2.5 ticks/second).

The key insight is that **handle-based thread switching** can dramatically reduce overhead while maintaining the same syntax and functionality. Combined with **batching**, **memory optimization**, and **worker thread improvements**, this approach should achieve the required performance targets.

The implementation plan is designed to be **incremental** and **low-risk**, with each phase building on the previous one and providing measurable performance improvements. The final result should be a scheduler that can handle 100 zones efficiently (5x improvement over current 20 zones) while maintaining the elegant coroutine syntax that makes the codebase maintainable and readable.

**Key Achievement:** Symmetric transfer operations already exceed the 2.5 ticks/second target, demonstrating that the coroutine approach is fundamentally sound. The challenge is optimizing thread switching to enable scaling to 100 zones.

**Architectural Trade-off:** The performance requirements necessitate breaking the original encapsulation boundary between coroutines and scheduler. This tight coupling is essential for handle-based optimizations and represents a deliberate design decision to prioritize performance over architectural purity.

**Clean Dependency Management:** Despite the tight coupling, we maintain clean dependency injection by automatically propagating scheduler references through the coroutine promise system. This approach is completely invisible to client code while ensuring testability and avoiding the complexity of global/static/thread_local scheduler management.

**Execution Model:** Tasks (coroutines) are no longer standalone entities - they require a scheduler to execute. This fundamental change is justified by the dramatic performance improvements and the fact that the scheduler reference propagation is completely transparent to user code.

## LandSandBoat Impact Calculation Methodology

### Overview
The LandSandBoat impact represents the total time the scheduler would take to process one tick of a LandSandBoat zone server, based on the measured performance of individual operations.

### Calculation Formula
```
LandSandBoat Impact (ms) = (Per Operation Overhead (μs) × Number of Operations) ÷ 1000
```

### Key Parameters
- **Number of Operations:** 1,980 coroutines per tick (based on LandSandBoat server analysis)
- **Per Operation Overhead:** Measured from test results in microseconds
- **Conversion Factor:** 1000 (to convert from microseconds to milliseconds)

### Calculation Examples

#### Example 1: Pure Symmetric Transfer
```
Per Operation Overhead: 125μs
Number of Operations: 1,980
LandSandBoat Impact = (125 × 1,980) ÷ 1000 = 247,500μs = 247ms
```

#### Example 2: Single Thread Switch
```
Per Operation Overhead: 22,153μs
Number of Operations: 1,980
LandSandBoat Impact = (22,153 × 1,980) ÷ 1000 = 43,862,940μs = 43,862ms
```

#### Example 3: Mixed Workload (Realistic)
```
Per Operation Overhead: 59,982μs
Number of Operations: 1,980
LandSandBoat Impact = (59,982 × 1,980) ÷ 1000 = 118,764,360μs = 118,764ms
```

### Assumptions and Limitations

#### LandSandBoat Workload Characteristics
- **1,980 coroutines per tick:** Based on analysis of actual LandSandBoat server code
- **Mixed workload:** Combination of Task and AsyncTask operations
- **Realistic pattern:** Task->Task->Task->Task->AsyncTask chains
- **Pathfinding operations:** 5ms simulated work per AsyncTask

#### Test Methodology
- **Isolated measurements:** Each test measures specific operation patterns
- **Microsecond precision:** High-resolution timing for accurate measurements
- **Statistical sampling:** Multiple runs to ensure consistent results
- **Overhead calculation:** Total time minus expected work time

#### Extrapolation Considerations
- **Linear scaling:** Assumes overhead scales linearly with operation count
- **No contention effects:** Tests run in isolation, not under full server load
- **Simplified workload:** Tests use synthetic workloads, not actual game logic
- **Memory pressure:** Tests don't account for memory allocation pressure

### Validation and Verification

#### Cross-Reference with Real Data
- **Target performance:** 200ms per tick (from LandSandBoat requirements)
- **Current non-scheduler performance:** ~400ms per tick (baseline)
- **Scheduler overhead:** Additional overhead from coroutine management
- **Thread switching cost:** Primary contributor to performance degradation

#### Confidence Intervals
- **Symmetric transfer:** High confidence (consistent, low variance)
- **Thread switching:** High confidence (consistent, high overhead)
- **Mixed workloads:** Medium confidence (varies with workload composition)
- **Batching effects:** Medium confidence (depends on batching strategy)

### Alternative Calculation Methods

#### Method 1: Direct Measurement
```
LandSandBoat Impact = Direct measurement of full tick processing time
```
**Pros:** Most accurate, includes all overhead
**Cons:** Requires full LandSandBoat integration, complex setup

#### Method 2: Component Summation
```
LandSandBoat Impact = Σ(Component Overhead × Component Frequency)
```
**Pros:** Detailed breakdown, identifies bottlenecks
**Cons:** May miss interaction effects, complex to calculate

#### Method 3: Statistical Sampling
```
LandSandBoat Impact = Statistical sampling of real server performance
```
**Pros:** Real-world data, includes all effects
**Cons:** Requires production server, may vary with load
