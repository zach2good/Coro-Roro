- Please go through all the git commit history since the beginning of the repo, looking at the test/ folder specifically, to make sure you capture the historical tests where we were debugging interval tasks not rescheduling, and then the tests which exposed the long tick times. It's important this behaviour is captured and reproduced so we can test against it. Please write your findings in a document.
- Make sure the delayed and interval task system (with cancellation tokens) is correctly captures in tests, and then implemented.
- Fix all crashes, the tests must pass and be stable before we continue.
- We must performance test the whole system with complex workloads to make it as performant as possible, and reduce the cost of thread context switching as much as possible. It's still too slow for use. Once all tests are passing for correctness (not performance) we can start being very aggressive about performance improvements.
- It's possible in my client code to work out: "if the distance between these two points is small enough, run the navmesh/pathfinding code inline, otherwise ship to a worker thread" to try and reduce the context switching cost. What do you think?
