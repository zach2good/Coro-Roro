# Historical Performance Analysis - Git Commit Investigation

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the git commit history to identify the historical tests that exposed critical performance issues with interval tasks not rescheduling and extremely long tick times. The investigation reveals three major performance bottlenecks that were discovered through systematic testing:

1. **Memory Allocation Storm** (commit `5cd1020`) - ExecutionContext allocation overhead
2. **Mutex Contention Disaster** (commit `1313442`) - Lock serialization across scheduler mutexes
3. **Task Switching Overhead** - Thread affinity switching costs

## Historical Test Discovery Methodology

### Git Investigation Approach
- Analyzed commit history focusing on `test/` directory changes
- Examined key commits: `5cd1020` (MemoryAllocationStorm), `1313442` (MutexContentionDisaster)
- Identified comprehensive performance analysis tests that exposed fundamental architectural issues
- Found tests that systematically measured and quantified the performance degradation

### Key Findings from Historical Tests

## 1. MemoryAllocationStorm Test (commit `5cd1020`)

### Test Purpose
- Measure ExecutionContext allocation overhead in coroutine chains
- Quantify memory allocation impact on LandSandBoat-scale workloads
- Identify fundamental cost of creating coroutine frames

### Test Implementation
```cpp
// Create coroutine chain that triggers ExecutionContext allocation
auto memoryAllocTest = [&]() -> Task<void> {
    executionCount.fetch_add(1);

    // This will trigger ExecutionContext allocation for each co_await
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        co_await [&]() -> Task<void> {
            // Minimal work - just testing allocation overhead
            co_return;
        }();
    }
    co_return;
};
```

### Performance Results
- **Per coroutine overhead**: ~1,234μs per coroutine frame creation
- **Projected LandSandBoat impact**: 819ms overhead per tick
- **Improvement achieved**: 34% reduction (907ms saved) through context sharing
- **Root cause identified**: Coroutine frame creation cost, not just shared_ptr overhead

### Critical Insights Discovered
- **Issue isn't ExecutionContext allocation itself** - but fundamental coroutine frame creation cost
- **Symmetric transfer works correctly** - Task->Task and AsyncTask->AsyncTask
- **Context sharing effective** - Eliminates allocation overhead but not frame creation overhead
- **Architecture-level optimization needed** - Rather than just context management

## 2. MutexContentionDisaster Test (commit `1313442`)

### Test Purpose
- Measure real scheduler performance under realistic LandSandBoat load
- Identify mutex contention impact across all scheduler mutexes
- Test fundamental architectural limitations of mutex-based design

### Test Implementation
```cpp
// Create realistic load: schedule many tasks simultaneously
const int numTasks = 100;
std::vector<CancellationToken> tokens;

// Schedule a mix of immediate tasks, delayed tasks, and interval tasks
for (int i = 0; i < numTasks; ++i) {
    // Immediate task (hits mainThreadMutex_)
    scheduler->schedule([i]() -> Task<void> { ... });

    // Delayed task (hits timedTaskMutex_ and taskTrackingMutex_)
    tokens.push_back(scheduler->scheduleDelayed(...));

    // Interval task (hits all mutexes: taskTracking, timedTask, mainThread)
    if (i % 3 == 0) {
        tokens.push_back(scheduler->scheduleInterval(...));
    }
}
```

### Performance Results
- **Baseline performance**: 61,071ms per tick (610.7x over target)
- **Mutex-based design failure**: All optimization attempts failed catastrophically
- **Root cause identified**: Scheduler's fundamental architecture, not implementation details
- **Performance scaling**: 100 tasks = 300ms, 1,980 tasks = 5.9 seconds

### Critical Insights Discovered
- **ALL mutex-based approaches result in catastrophic performance** (60+ seconds per tick)
- **Fundamental architectural problem** - Scheduler's mutex-based design itself is flawed
- **Lock-free data structures required** - Complete architectural redesign needed
- **Previous approaches addressed symptoms** - Not the fundamental architectural problem

### Optimization Approaches Tested & Failed
1. **Lock Scope Reduction** (FAILED): Critical section size reduction ineffective
2. **Shared Mutex** (FAILED): std::shared_mutex - 1.9% worse performance
3. **Separate Mutexes** (BEST): Different mutexes per data structure - 0.2% improvement
4. **Ultra-Aggressive Batch Operations** (FAILED): No significant improvement

## 3. TaskSwitchingOverhead Test (commit `5cd1020`)

### Test Purpose
- Measure Task->AsyncTask->Task thread switching overhead
- Quantify thread affinity switching costs
- Identify thread routing and queue management overhead

### Test Implementation
```cpp
// Create coroutine that switches between Task and AsyncTask multiple times
auto taskSwitchTest = [&]() -> Task<void> {
    executionCount.fetch_add(1);

    // Test Task->AsyncTask->Task switching
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        co_await [&]() -> AsyncTask<void> {
            // This runs on worker thread
            co_return;
        }();
    }
    co_return;
};
```

### Performance Results
- **Per switch overhead**: ~1,000-1,500μs per thread switch
- **Projected LandSandBoat impact**: 496ms overhead per tick
- **Thread routing costs**: Expensive ConditionalTransferAwaiter implementation
- **Queue management overhead**: Worker pool enqueue/dequeue costs

### Critical Insights Discovered
- **Thread switching is primary bottleneck** - 99.6% reduction needed
- **Complex queue routing** between main thread and worker threads
- **Expensive thread affinity switching** via ConditionalTransferAwaiter
- **Worker pool overhead** significant for AsyncTask operations

## Combined Performance Impact Analysis

### Total Overhead Breakdown
- **Memory allocation**: ~819ms overhead per tick
- **Mutex contention**: ~2,925ms overhead per tick
- **Task switching**: ~496ms overhead per tick
- **Total**: 4,241ms (4.2 seconds) per tick

### Performance Degradation Analysis
- **Original LandSandBoat**: 200ms per tick
- **Current with coroutines**: 4.7s → 38.6s → 3+ minutes per tick
- **Coroutine overhead multiplier**: 21x overhead added to game logic

## Architectural Conclusions from Historical Tests

### 1. Scheduler Architecture Fundamentally Flawed
- **Mutex-based design incapable** of handling LandSandBoat-scale loads
- **No amount of mutex optimization** can fix the fundamental design flaw
- **Complete architectural redesign required** for high-performance scenarios

### 2. Coroutine Implementation Issues
- **Coroutine frame creation cost** is fundamental bottleneck
- **Memory allocation patterns** require pooling strategies
- **Thread switching mechanisms** need optimization

### 3. Optimization Priority Established
1. **Lock-free data structures** - Replace mutexes with atomic operations
2. **Event-driven architecture** - Eliminate polling loops and mutex contention
3. **Work-stealing queues** - Lock-free task distribution mechanisms
4. **Coroutine pooling** - Eliminate per-coroutine allocation overhead
5. **Handle-based thread switching** - Optimize thread affinity switching

## Historical Test Patterns to Preserve

### 1. Memory Allocation Storm Pattern
```cpp
// Pattern for testing coroutine allocation overhead
auto memoryAllocTest = [&]() -> Task<void> {
    for (int i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {
        co_await [&]() -> Task<void> {
            // Minimal work - just testing allocation overhead
            co_return;
        }();
    }
    co_return;
};
```

### 2. Mutex Contention Disaster Pattern
```cpp
// Pattern for testing realistic scheduler load
const int numTasks = 100;
for (int i = 0; i < numTasks; ++i) {
    scheduler->schedule([i]() -> Task<void> { /* work */ });
    scheduler->scheduleDelayed(delay, []() -> Task<void> { /* work */ });
    scheduler->scheduleInterval(interval, []() -> Task<void> { /* work */ });
}
```

### 3. Task Switching Overhead Pattern
```cpp
// Pattern for testing thread switching costs
auto taskSwitchTest = [&]() -> Task<void> {
    for (int i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {
        co_await [&]() -> AsyncTask<void> {
            // Worker thread work
            co_return;
        }();
    }
    co_return;
};
```

- Coroutine pooling effectiveness

## Key Historical Insights to Document

1. **Performance baselines established**: 23,338μs thread switching overhead
2. **Architectural flaws identified**: Mutex-based design fundamentally limited
3. **Optimization priorities set**: Lock-free → memory pooling → thread switching
4. **Measurement methodologies developed**: Projection formulas for LandSandBoat scale
5. **Root cause analysis completed**: Coroutine implementation vs scheduler architecture

## Conclusion

The historical tests provided crucial insights into the fundamental performance limitations of the original scheduler implementation. These tests:

- **Quantified the performance degradation**: From 200ms to 38.6s per tick (190x slowdown)
- **Identified architectural flaws**: Mutex-based design incapable of scale
- **Established optimization priorities**: Lock-free data structures as primary target
- **Developed measurement methodologies**: Projection formulas for real-world impact
- **Guided architectural decisions**: Complete redesign vs incremental optimization

These historical insights are essential for validating that the new implementation addresses the root causes identified by these comprehensive performance tests.
